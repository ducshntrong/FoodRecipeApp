# Libraries and technologies used
- Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.
- Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.
- Room : Save meals in local database.
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
- Firebase : User can register an account, recipes CRUD
